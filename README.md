Hey there, this is my code for Task 5, Sentiment Analysis:

Here, I have used the BERT-small model due to limitations on my laptop and kaggle. The dataset that I trained on is the Sentiment140 Dataset. The model was only trained on a part of it( about a fifth) due to computation limitations.

Please find the training results of the model below:

I have deployed the model using Gradio, here's how it looks:

The gradio can be made public by using ngrok.

Feel free to run the code and check it out
